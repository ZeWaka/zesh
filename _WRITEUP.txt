Bugs / Incomplete:
  My program doesn't allow a process to use the timeout feature, as well as the background feature.
    They somewhat work, but if you run another command while the background process is running, it won't timeout anymore.
    The background feature will override.
  My program is whitespace-sensitive for the control characters. Couldn't easily get it to work with other features otherwise.
